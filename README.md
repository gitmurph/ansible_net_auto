CCIE 16665 Emeritus. Working in the Network Engineering since the late 90's. 

Repo for network automation scripts discussed on my youtube channel: 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXEd_waNeuE3pyGAo05ETnw

Each video will be added as a separate branch. With each branch will be a sub-directory using the following naming convention

v<<number>>-<<text>>  for example 
v3-vars 
v4-facts 

where v3 = video3 as per the youtube channel.
